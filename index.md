Hey there! I'm a second year PhD candidate in the [Bo Wang Lab](https://wanglab.ml/), Department of Medical Biophysics, at the University of Toronto and The Vector Institute. I'm also co-supervised by [Kieran Campbell](https://www.camlab.ca/) and [Michael Taylor](https://lab.research.sickkids.ca/taylor/).

My research involves the development and application of machine learning and computational biology methods in single-cell genomics, particularly on integrating disparate and multi-modal single-cell datasets.

## Research interests

Using representation learning techniques, I'm working to develop methods for integrating single-cell data from different experiments and sequencing runs. Particularly, I'm working on method development for unsupervised integration, integration of imbalanced datasets, integration across different modalities, and diagnosing the results of these techniques in an unsupervised setting. I also work on applications of single-cell RNA sequencing in pediatric hindbrain tumors.
