title: About me
---

Hey there! I'm a first year PhD student in the Department of Medical Biophysics at the University of Toronto and The Vector Institute. 

I'm primarily supervised by [Dr. Bo Wang](https://wanglab.ml/), and co-supervised by [Dr. Michael Taylor](https://lab.research.sickkids.ca/taylor/) and [Dr. Kieran Campbell](https://www.camlab.ca/). 

### Research interests

Using representation learning techniques, I'm working to develop methods for integrating single-cell data from different experiments and sequencing runs. Particularly, I'm working on method development for unsupervised integration, integration of imbalanced datasets, integration across different modalities, and diagnosing the results of these techniques. I also work on applications of single-cell RNA sequencing in pediatric hindbrain cancers.

If you'd like to chat about any of these topics, feel free to [shoot me an email](mailto:hurmaan99@gmail.com).
